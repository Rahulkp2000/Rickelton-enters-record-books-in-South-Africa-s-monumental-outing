After seeing the shortest completed Test ever to begin 2024, Newlands has hosted a rare high-scoring outing to mark the start of 2025. Here are all the key numbers after Day 2 of the ongoing second Test between South Africa and Pakistan in Cape Town:

8 400-plus totals in Tests in South Africa since the start of 2018, South Africa's 615 all-out making for a rare high-scoring outing in the country. For context, in the seven-year period between 2018 and 2024, the average first innings total in a Test innings in South Africa was 286 - only higher than in the West Indies (268 in 27 Tests) and Ireland (260 in two Tests) among the 12 countries to have hosted Test cricket in the timeframe.https://rklogin.in/2025/01/05/who-is-hardik-pandyas-new-wife-kylie-jenner/

25.73 was the average runs per wicket in 30 Tests in South Africa in between 2018 and 2024, only ahead of 25.73 in Ireland (two Tests). Of the 41 Tests that had an average runs per wicket of 40-plus in the time-frame, only one was played in South Africa - in Centurion in 2020/21.

It was only the third occasion in which 300-plus runs have been added on each of the first two days of a Test in South Africa since the 2016 New Year's Test at the same venue. The previous two instances were the two Tests between the hosts and Sri Lanka in Centurion and Johannesburg respectively during the 2020/21 season.

15 sixes is the joint second-most hit by South Africa in a Test innings; they'd hit as many against the West Indies at Basseterre in 2010 and 17 against Bangladesh in Chattogram earlier this season.

Rickelton's day out

259 by Ryan Rickelton is the record for any opening batsman batting for the first time in Tests. Only three batsmen who had opened on Test debut ever scored double-hundreds before him.

Score Played Team vs Opponent Venue, Year

259 Ryan Rickelton South Africa v Pakistan Cape Town, 2025

201* Brendon Kuruppu Sri Lanka v New Zealand Colombo CCC, 1987

200 Graeme Smith South Africa v Bangladesh East London, 2002

200 Devon Conway New Zealand v England Lord's, 2021
The innings was the first Test double-hundred for South Africa since Ben Stokes (258) and Hashim Amla (201) got there at the same venue in the 2016 New Year's Test. The former's is the second-fastest Test double ever, taken off just 163 balls, while the latter's was the last to be scored for the Proteas in Tests. Coincidentally, that innings too featured a hundred by Temba Bavuma (102* - the first of his career).

75.51 - The rate at which Ryan Rickelton scored his 343-ball stay at the crease. Of the ten 250-plus scores recorded for South Africa in Tests, this is the fastest.

5 individual scores of 250-plus in Tests in South Africa, three of which have come in Cape Town. In fact, of the 19 Test doubles to have been scored in South Africa till date, seven have come at Newlands - the most at a venue in the country. Rickelton's 259 also happens to be the fourth double hundred for South Africa against Pakistan in Tests, and the second-highest score in head-to-head contests, after AB de Villiers' 278* in Abu Dhabi in 2010.

An innings of class and control

4.9% - Percentage of balls with a false shot in Rickelton's innings, the third-lowest among the 132 Test double hundreds scored since 2009. Only Kane Williamson's 200 against Bangladesh in 2019 (3.1%) and Tom Latham's 264 against Sri Lanka in 2018 (4.6%), rank higher in this aspect among the double hundreds in the mentioned time period.

99 off 90 by Rickelton off balls that came back of a length or shorter from the quicks when he was in. Of all Test innings for which ball-by-ball data is available, only two have featured more runs in this range - 110(152) by Kane Williamson during his 238 against Pakistan in 2021 and 103(104) by Tom Latham during his 252 against Bangladesh in 2022- both at Christchurch's Hagley Oval. Thus, South African batsmen collectively scored 217 off 219 against these sorts of deliveries-the fourth best in an innings of a Test where data is available.

Of the 150 Test double-hundreds scored since July 2006, Rickelton's 259 is the most evenly split in terms of balls played off the front foot (50%) and back-foot (48.8%), the next closest in this regard being Alastair Cook's 244 at the MCG in 2017/18 (51.1% off the front foot and 47.4% off the back foot).

Pakistan continue to struggle on either fronts

5 - Of the nine 600-plus totals registered in Tests since 2021, five have been against Pakistan, including England's 823/7d in Multan earlier this season. Overall, there have been nine 600-plus totals across the three World Test Championship cycles, five of them against Pakistan. No other team has conceded 600-plus more than once in WTC history. Moreover, there had been 11 instances of the same three individual hundreds being registered within a Test inning since 2021, that too against Pakistan - the maximum against a particular team.

4 - Pakistan bowlers - Mir Hamza (2/127), Khurram Shahzad (2/123), Aamer Jamal (0/110) and Salman Agha (3/148) - gave away 100-plus in the first innings. There have been four such cases of four or more bowlers giving away 100-plus runs in a Test innings since 2021, three involving Pakistan.
12.20 - The average opening partnership for Pakistan in Tests since 2024, the lowest among the 12 Test playing teams. Among the 12 teams, Pakistan is the only one not to have a single 50-plus opening stand in this period, the highest being 49 in the second innings of the last Test in Centurion. 10 of their 15 opening partnerships since 2024 have been in single-digits, four of them being broken without a run on the board.

Rizwan and Abbas enter record books

6 dismissals by Mohamamad Rizwan is the joint second-most for a Pakistan wicketkeeper in a Test innings, alongside Rashid Latif against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo, 1998 and Adnan Akmal against New Zealand in Wellington, 2011; only behind Wasim Bari's seven against the Blackcaps in Auckland in 1979. Earlier on Day 1, Rizwan became the seventh Pakistan wicketkeeper to complete 100 dismissals in Tests, taking his tally to 104 by the end of the innings.

100 Test wickets for Mohammad Abbas, the right-arm quick becoming the 20th bowler to get there for Pakistan. At 34y, 300d, he is the oldest to the milestone among them, surpassing Saeed Ajmal (34y, 106d). Among the 20 bowlers with 100 Test wickets for Pakistan, he now has the second best bowling average (22.99), marginally behind Imran Khan (362 wickets at 22.81).

35% - 35 of Abbas' 100 Test wickets have been leg-before. Of the 277 bowlers to have bagged at least 75 Test wickets till date, he has the highest percentage of leg-before dismissals, followed by Terry Alderman (58 out of 170, 34.11%).
